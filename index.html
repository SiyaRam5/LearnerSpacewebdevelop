        <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
        <p>Want to start playing basketball? Here's what you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> You'll need a basketball and a hoop. Standard hoops are 10 feet high.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Rules:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basketball is played with two teams of five players each.</li>
                    <li>The objective is to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop.</li>
                    <li>You can move the ball by dribbling (bouncing the ball) or passing it to a teammate.</li>
                    <li>Each team has a basket that they defend while trying to score in the opponent's basket.</li>
                    <li>A game typically consists of four quarters, each lasting 10-12 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Positions:</strong> Players usually have specific roles such as:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Point Guard:</strong> The team's primary ball handler and playmaker.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shooting Guard:</strong> A player who is good at shooting from long distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small Forward:</strong> A versatile player who can play both offense and defense.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Forward:</strong> A strong player who plays near the basket.</li>
                    <li><strong>Center:</strong> The tallest player who plays near the basket and is responsible for rebounding and shot-blocking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Basic Techniques:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dribbling:</strong> Use your fingertips to bounce the ball on the floor. Keep your head up to see the court.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shooting:</strong> Aim for the square on the backboard for layups, and use proper form for jump shots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Passing:</strong> Use chest passes, bounce passes, and overhead passes to move the ball to teammates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defense:</strong> Stay between your opponent and the basket. Use your body and hands to block shots and passes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Game Play:</strong> The game starts with a jump ball at center court. Teams score points by making field goals (2 or 3 points) or free throws (1 point).</li>
            <li><strong>Practice:</strong> To improve, practice dribbling, shooting, passing, and defensive skills regularly. Work on conditioning to stay fit and agile.</li>
        </ul>
